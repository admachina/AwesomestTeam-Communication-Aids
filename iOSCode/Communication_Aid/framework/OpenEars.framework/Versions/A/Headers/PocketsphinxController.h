- (void) suspendRecognition; // Stops interpreting sounds as speech without exiting from the recognition loop. You do not need to call these methods on behalf of Flite.
- (void) resumeRecognition; // Starts interpreting sounds as speech after suspending recognition with the preceding method. You do not need to call these methods on behalf of Flite.
- (void) changeLanguageModelToFile:(NSString *)languageModelPathAsString withDictionary:(NSString *)dictionaryPathAsString; // If you have already started the recognition loop and you want to switch to a different language model, you can use this and the model will be changed at the earliest opportunity. Will not have any effect unless recognition is already in progress.
